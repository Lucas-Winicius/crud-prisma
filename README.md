# Simple CRUD with SQL
> This is another CRUD made by me, but this time just for testing since I had never used a relational database and Prisma before. Even though this project is extremely lacking as it doesn't even have validation, I hope you like it. ðŸ˜º <br/> - Lucas Winicius

Since this is an extremely simple and somewhat inconsistent API, I will only provide the installation guide.

<hr/>

## **Installation guide**

### Cloning the repository and installing dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucas-Winicius/crud-prisma.git
```

```bash
cd crud-prisma
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now that the project is installed along with the extensions, let's take a look at what to do next. <br/>

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory following the `.env.template` standards.
- To execute, use the command:

```bash
npm start:dev
```

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

```bash
pnpm start:dev
```
Before finishing, I would like to say that in the future I will create a new API using Prisma and a relational database.

**Thank you for reading up to this point.**
